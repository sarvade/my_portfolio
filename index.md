### I am experienced in AI applications, machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results.

#### *One of the things I quickly realized is sometimes you have to gather, organize, and clean your own data.*

I care less about doing fancy modeling and care more about working with interesting data. That's why I use **webscraping** - which is a great way to get interesting data.

Here are some nuggets of information to build great projects:

- Use Real Data
- Scrape Your Own Data
- Ask for Data
- Use Publicly Accessible APIs
- Pick Interesting Data Over Everything Else
- Pick Something Youâ€™re Curious About, Not Something You Hope Will Be Impressive
- Pick an Analysis That is Interesting Regardless of What You Find
- Perfect the Visuals
- Make Your Data Interactive (Optional)
