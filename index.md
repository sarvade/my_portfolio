#### My passion for AI has led me on a journey to explore Artificial General Intelligence, which represents one of the most exciting and promising areas in computer science.

This website exists to share my thoughts and insights on AI, machine learning, and deep learning, as well as aerospace engineering. My plan is to post a new blog once a week on a topic that I find particularly interesting or that I believe will be of relevance to my readers.

As someone with both an academic and professional background in aerospace engineering and machine learning, I've always been fascinated by the intersection between technology and science, and I believe that AI represents a powerful tool in advancing these disciplines even further.

I hope that through this website, you will find the same excitement and inspiration that drives my own passion for AI and aerospace engineering. Please take a moment to explore my work, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a collaboration.
